Today is your luck day!
Be aware of wolf in sheep's clothing
Everyone is the author of his own good fortune
A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step.
Always put your best foot forward.
A thing begun is half done.
Don’t blow your own trumpet.
Don’t cross a bridge until you come to it.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
Don’t put the cart before the horse.
Don’t throw the baby with the bathwater.
Early bird catches the worm.
Easy come, easy go.
Empty bags cannot stand upright.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Every man is the architect of his destiny.
Fall seven times. Stand up eight.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
Fortune favors the brave.
God helps those who help themselves.
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
If the mountain won’t come to Muhammad, Muhammad must go to the mountain.
If you can’t beat them, join them.
It’s not over till it’s over.
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.
Learn to walk before you run.
Money doesn’t grow on trees.
 Lightning never strikes twice in the same place.
